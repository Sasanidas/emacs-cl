TODO: Write proper installation instructions.

To load the files, load load-cl.el into Emacs.  Warning: Loading the
last file, populate.el, will take a long time, especially on slow
computers.

To start an interactive session, type "M-x emacs-cl".

To compile the files, type "M-x compile-cl".  (Loading compiled files
is not tested frequently, so may not work.)
